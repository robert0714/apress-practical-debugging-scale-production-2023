# Part I. Basics - Chapter 4. Logging, Testing, and Fail-Fast

This is a chapter about preventing future pain. We can significantly impact our future debugging experience by writing code that’s easier to debug. Many best practices such as KISS(``Keep It Simple Stupid – don’t complicate things.``), DRY(``Don’t Repeat Yourself – reuse code instead of writing the same logic over again.``) etc., will significantly improve your debugging experience.
